    "\n",
    "Let's try `DBSCAN` on our toy dataset. K-Means is kind of bound to the Euclidean distance because it is based on the notion of means. With `DBSCAN` we can try different distance metrics. In the context of text (sparse data), [cosine similarities](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html#cosine-similarity) or cosine distances tend to work better. Given vectors $u$ and $v$, the **cosine distance** between the vectors is defined as: \n",

    "In this exercise, you'll use DBSCAN with cosine distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use DBSCAN to cluster our toy data using sentence embedding representation (`emb_sents`) and `metric='cosine'`. \n",
    "2. Briefly comment on the number of clusters identified and the cluster assignment given by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note: You will also have to set appropriate values for the hyperparamters `eps` and `min_samples` to get meaningful clusters, as default values for these hyperparameters won't work on this toy dataset. In order to set appropriate value for `eps`, you may want to examine the distances given by [sklearn's `cosine_distance`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_distances.html).*"

    "The DBSCAN plot is a bit harder to interpret with the PCA representation. We do see that close points are *generally* grouped together, but based on the plot, we should see a cluster of 5 points in the bottom left corner. Clearly with so many features (768) it is very hard to compress this down to two dimensions. There is clearly a lot more going on with regard to fitting this algorithm. In either case, the results are reasonably close to ideal."
